        <h1>Award-Winning Profesional Training</h1>
        <p>  <a href="http://www.qa.com" target="_blank">QA Ltd</a> was formed in 1985 by three former Intel employees: <strong>Mike Cheeseman, Jim Watt and Howard Kornstein.</strong> 
            The name was inspired by a combination of Queen Anne House in Cirencester, the company's first offices, and the term 'quality assurance'. The trio soon moved into the Cirencester Park Estate, 
            where the Earl Bathurst was their landlord.</p>
